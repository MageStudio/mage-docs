# Element

Every physical object you add to your level is an instance of the Element class. This class extends the Entity class, which is described in its own page [here](/engine/advanced/core/entity.md).

By "physical object", we mean Models and each of the Base Elements. Each base element is described in its page.

- [Cube](/engine/advanced/core/base/cube.md)
- [Box](/engine/advanced/core/base/box.md)
- [Sphere](/engine/advanced/core/base/sphere.md)
- [Cylinder](/engine/advanced/core/base/cylinder.md)
- [Plane](/engine/advanced/core/base/plane.md)
- [Line](/engine/advanced/core/base/line.md)
- [CurvedLine](/engine/advanced/core/base/curvedline.md)
- [Grid](/engine/advanced/core/base/grid.md)
- [Sprite](/engine/advanced/core/base/sprite.md)
- [AnimatedSprite](/engine/advanced/core/base/animatedsprite.md)

## Methods

#### constructor(geometry: ThreeGeometry, material: ThreeMaterial, options: Object)

The Element constructor will set the body if both geometry and material are provided.

?> Element extends Entity, so refer to the the Entity constructor for additional information ([here](/engine/advanced/core/entity.md?id=constructor)).

- `options` gives the Element constructor additional information. Here are the currently supported values:
  - `name: string`: If not provided, Mage will create one by default.
  - `addUniverse: boolean`: (default: `true`). This flag determines whether the element will receive updates or not. When set to `false`, the element will be rendered on the screen, but it will not receive updates.
  - `tags: string[]`: A list of initial tags for this element.

?> For more information about tags, please refer to the Entity document page [here](/engine/advanced/core/entity.md).

#### hasMesh(): boolean

Checks if this element has an attached mesh. Returns `true` if the mesh is present, `false` otherwise.

#### getMesh(): ThreeMesh

This method will return the ThreeMesh attached to this element if present.

#### getMeshByName(name: string): ThreeMesh

This method will search for the ThreeMesh with the required name inside this element. If found, it will be returned. If not found, `undefined` will be returned.

#### setMesh({ mesh?: ThreeMesh, geometry?: ThreeGeometry, material?: ThreeMaterial })

This method sets the ThreeMesh attached to this element. You have three options:

- `mesh`: an already existing ThreeMesh, will be attached to the element.
- `geometry` and `material`: these need to be instances of a ThreeGeometry and a ThreeMaterial. A ThreeMesh will be created and attached to the element.

> This method is used internally inside the constructor.

#### setName(name: string, options?: object)

This method sets the name of this element.

- `options` is optional, and only supports one value:
  - `replace` (default: `false`): if this value is set to `true`, the current ThreeMesh will be disposed and replaced.

#### add(element: Element)

This will add the received `element` to this element.

#### remove(element: Element)

This will remove a previously added `element` from this element.

#### setColor(color: string|number)

- `color` can be a string representation of a color (e.g. 'black', '#fefefe'), or its hex value (e.g. 0x000000 for black).

#### setTextureMap(textureId: string, options: Object)

This method will set the texture map for this element.
- `textureId: string`: This represents the texture you want to map on this element. It has to be a valid textureId, defined in your `assets` definition.

?> Please refer to the page explaining how to load textures in your applications [here](/engine/advanced/assets/images_and_textures.md)

#### setMaterialFromName(materialName: MaterialType, options; Object)`

This method changes the type of material used for this element. 

- `materialName` can be one of the following values:
```javascript
const MATERIALS = {
    LAMBERT: 0,
    PHONG: 1,
    DEPTH: 2,
    STANDARD: 3,
    BASIC: 4
};
```
- `options: object`: These options will be passed to the Material.

#### setOpacity(value: number)

- `value` (default: `1`): This value sets the opacity of this element. Value can only assume values between `0` and `1`.

#### setWireframe(flag: boolean)

- `flag`: when it's set to true, this element will be rendered as wireframe.

#### setWireframeLineWidth(width: number)

- `width` will set the width of the wireframe lines. In order for this to work, you need to call `element.setWireframe(true)` first.

#### toJSON()

This will return a JSON representation of this element.

---

## Animations

#### playAnimation(id: string, options: Object)

If this element has animations and the require `id` is a valid animation identifier, that animation will be played.

- `options: { duration: 0.2 }`: This option is being used when transitioning from one animation to another.

#### getAvailableAnimations(): array<ThreeAnimation>

If this element has animations, this methods will return a list of them.

---

## Physics

#### enablePhysics(options: object)

If physics are enabled, this will add this element to the Physics Engine.

?> For a better description of the `options` object, have a look at the Physics page [here](/engine/advanced/physics.md).

#### applyForce(force: Object)

#### setColliders(vectors: array, options: array)

#### checkCollisions()

#### isCollidingOnDirection(direction: Object)
